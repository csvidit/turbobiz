Create a business idea. Fast.

## How it works

The web application itself is made in NextJS using TypeScript as much as possible. It generates a prompt and then calls OpenAI's DaVinci API. The results are then parsed and then presented one-by-one to the user. Should the user want to do so, they can also open a Google Domains search page for buying a domain name close to the suggested business name.

OpenAI's API pricing is quite expensive, therefore this app is not hosted on a domain name to prevent misuse. People are free to fork this (with attribution) and then use their own API keys to use the app.
