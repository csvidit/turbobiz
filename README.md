# turbobiz

Create a business idea. Fast.

## How it works

The web application itself is made in NextJS using TypeScript as much as possible. It generates a prompt and then calls OpenAI's ChatCompletions API for the GPT 3.5 Turbo model (more cost effective, with similar results for our use case). The results is then parsed and presented to the user. Should the user want to do so, they can also open a Google Domains search page for buying a domain name close to the suggested business name.
